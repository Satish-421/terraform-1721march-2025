# Day 3

## Info - Ansible Automation Platform
<pre>
- was also called as Ansible Tower
- it is developed on top the AWX (open source)
- AWX is developed on top Ansible core (open source)
- unlike Ansible core, Ansible automation platform supports webconsole, user management, etc.,
- this is a Red Hat Enterprise product with world-wide support
- functionally AWX and Ansible Automation Platform are one and same
- it is not possible develop Ansible Playbook within AWX or Ansible Automation Platform
- hence, we still need Ansible core to develop playbooks and test them before we push it to GitHub or any version control
- the existing Ansible Playbooks we can execute via Ansible Automation Platform
- can be installed as a stand-alone application on any Linux Distributions or we can install inside Kubernetes or Openshift
</pre>
